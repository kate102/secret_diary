The purpose of this exercise is three fold.

First of I want to consolidate my TDD skills so that I get into a good rhythm and good habits.
The README_TDD.md file outlines my thought process in terms of testing in irb, the rspec and finally coding.
I want to show the steps that I took and include the irb statements.

Secondly I want understand the OO principles provided in the course outline. 
I was to incorporate them in my code and highlight in the code the areas that demonstrate my understanding.
The README_OO.md file describes my understanding and where these principles are present in this project.

Finally I wanted to get to grips with some of the programming techniques that we need to master.
The 4th README (this one being the first) README_CODING.md higlights how I have understood and met these standards.
