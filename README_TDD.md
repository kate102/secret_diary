# This challenge is to take a simple Secret Diary class description and implement it using Test Driven Development methods.
 The functionality neatly follows a path of collections of functional enhancements.
 Each of these are broken down in to 'fail-able' isolated steps, the irb test is documented below for each of these.
 Once a test fails in irb, the spec file is updated with that test. 
 Where possible I have tested for behavior rather than state.
 

## The basic secret diary has the following functions
SecretDiary
  - lock
  - unlock
  - add_entry
  - get_entries

# Initially the `SecretDiary` class is locked, meaning `add_entry` and `get_entries` should throw an error.
# When the user calls `unlock`, `add_entry` and `get_entries` should work as desired.
# When the user calls `lock` again they throw errors again.

# Basic Test Outline
1. Try to create a secret_diary object in irb
 - this will fail
2. Move this test to  the spec file
 - this will fail rspec
3. Create a basic object in .rb file
 - this should succeed
4. for each of the functions in turn 
	a - try to invoke in irb
	b - try to invoke using rspec
	c - enhance the code

# Basic Tests
secret_diary = SecretDiary.new
secret_diary.lock
secret_diary.unlock
secret_diary.add_entry
secret_diary.get_entries

# Enhanced Test Outline
1. the diary is locked when initialized
2. add_entry should throw an error
3. get_entry should throw an error
4. unlock should work
5. add_entry should work
6. get_entry should work
7. lock should work
8. add_entry should throw an error
9. get_entry should throw an error

# Enhanced Tests
secret_diary = SecretDiary.new
secret_diary.locked? # => true
secret_diary.add_entry # => Error Message
secret_diary.get_entry # => Error Message
secret_diary.unlock
secret_diary.add_entry
secret_diary.get_entries
secret_diary.locked? # => false
secret_diary.lock
secret_diary.add_entry # => Error Message
secret_diary.get_entry # => Error Message

############################## 
# Now my task is to reorganise into different classes. 
# I would like a Lock class to not break the tests
# I now have a Lock class and a Diary class and the Secret Diary is a child of the Diary class

I now want to make sure that it can store and rerieve entries
1. Can I write a string to the secret diary calling the super class
2. Can I retrieve this?
3. Can I write a diary entry with a date
4. Can I add many diary entries with dates
5. Can I retrieve an entry by date

diary = Diary.new
diary.add_entry('text') => ["text"]

diary = Diary.new
diary.retrieve_entry => ["text"]
